# Big world alert: encoding vs encryption vs hashing

## 1. Encoding
- **Encoding**: is **data transformation** and the goal is not to keep the data secret but to **ensure the data has the right format** for proper consumption.

  ```
  querystring.stringify({"url": "http://domain.com"});
// outputs 'url=http%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com'
  ```
## 2. Encryption
- **Encryption**:  is **data transformation** where the goal is to **ensure that data cannot be consumed by any other user except for the intended recipients**.

Example:
A hashing algorithm or in practice, the bcrypt Node module to encrypt user passwords.

## 3. Hashing

## 4. Salt factors

- Case 1: To verify a hashed password without salt, you compute ```HS256(password)```, and compare
it with the data stored on the database.

If you have access to a hash table, it is easy to decode the passwords.

if 3 of your users have ```123456``` as its password, and you use ```HS256``` algorithm without a salt to save the password, you database would look like this:

|username    | password                         |
| ---------- |:--------------------------------:|
|user1       | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |
|user7       | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |
|user13      | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |

As soon as a hacker finds one password in a hash table, he knows all the other.

- Case 2: all three users have the same password, but you compute ```HS256(password+salt)``` to save the data
into your database.

|username    | salt | password                         |
| ---------- |:----:|: -------------------------------:|
|user1       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |  !!!!
|user7       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |  compute it
|user13      | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |

>Using this scheme, the hacker will have to bruteforce the hashes to get the passwords. It will take some time, but as soon as one password is cracked, all the others will be revealed too.

- Case 3: all the users have the same password, but we compute ```HS256(password+random salt)``
|username    | salt | password                         |
| ---------- |:----:|: -------------------------------:| !!compute it
|user1       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |
|user7       | ASDF | 8062279f0ba04fa6ee41d0a9e04f4c93 |
|user13      | ABCD | 5743092bfb79214247c50c4102af0b99 |

>In this case, even if all your users have the same password, the hacker cannot know without bruteforce every password. In this example the salt is very short, just 4 bytes, but you can use larger salts (128 bytes or more) and increase the difficulty to bruteforce the passwords

## 5. Bcrypt



```
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10; // <-- minimum is 1, higher means slower

/* To prepare a clear text password to be stored in a database */
const encrypt = (password, callback) => {
    bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR, (err, salt) => {
        if(err) {
          return callback(err);
        }
        bcrypt.hash(password, salt, (err, hash) => {
            if(err) {
              return callback(err);
            }
            callback(null, hash); // <-- contains the hash of the password + salt. Can be inserted into DB now.
        });
    });
};

/* 'candidatePassword' is the clear text password submitted by the user when logging in.
 * 'storedPassword' is the salted and hashed value stored in the database.
 * bcrypt will make sure the candidatePassword is correctly hashed (and salted if need be) before
 * making the comparison */
const comparePassword = (candidatePassword, storedPassword, callback) => {
    bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, storedPassword, (err, isMatch) => {
        if(err) {
          return callback(err);
        }
        callback(null, isMatch);
    });
};
```

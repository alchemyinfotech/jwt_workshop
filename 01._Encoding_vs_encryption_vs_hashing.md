# Big world alert: encoding vs encryption vs hashing

To understand how JSON web tokens are built, it is important to understand the difference among encryption,
encoding, and hashing.

## 1. Encoding
- **Encoding**: is **data transformation** and the goal is not to keep the data secret but to **ensure the data has the right format** for proper consumption.

Example:
  ```
  querystring.stringify({"url": "http://domain.com"});
  // outputs 'url=http%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com'
  ```

## 2. Encryption
- **Encryption**:  is **data transformation** where the goal is to **ensure that data cannot be consumed by any other user except for the intended recipients**. The data is converted to an unrecognizable (encrypted) form. It is used to protect sensitive information, since **decrypting encrypted data is only possible with the corresponding key**

Examples:
- **Symmetric key algorithms** use related or identical encryption keys for both encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric key algorithms** use different keys for encryption and decryption.

## 3. Hashing vs Encryption
Don't encrypt passwords. Though secure when encrypted, the **passwords can be decrypted with the encryption key**. Our program will need to save it somewhere in order to use it, so we are vulnerable to an attack stealing the encryption key and decrypting all the passwords.

Instead we should 'hash' passwords. Hashing is similar to encryption except that it is a one-way process and does not require a secret key. Each time we give a hash function the same input we get the same output. But we can't use the output to calculate the input. For example: 15 % 10 will always be 5. But if we have n % 10 = 5 we can't work out what n is, because there are infinite possibilities (5, 15, 25...).

## 4. Salt factors

Because a hash function will always give the same output for the same input an attacker with access to a database of hashed passwords could try hashing lots of possible passwords and seeing if the hashed output matches any of the hashed passwords. Precomputed lists of hashes (called 'hash tables') exist so an attacker doesn't even need to do the computation themselves.

To defend against this we should use 'salting'. We append a unique random string (known as the 'salt') to the password before hashing it. The addition of the salt changes the output hash. Hash tables are therefore no longer useful for attackers because the hashes they contain are for passwords without any additional salt.

Of course, if we are to test a user-submitted password against the one stored in the database we need to know the salt so we can add it to the submitted password before hashing. We can store the salt in clear text alongside the password in the database. It is not a problem that an attacker with access to the database could see it, because they'd need to compute the hash of every possible password plus the salt to make any use of it.

The effect of salting is to greatly increase the attacker's computation requirements because for each password in the database they need to calculate the hashes of all possible passwords plus the salt until they find a match. Plus, if each salt is unique then two identical passwords will be stored as different hashes because their salts will differ.

Another defensive technique is to add a 'work factor' to the hashing to make the computation harder and so slower. The aim is to make the computation seem quick to the user but slow enough (e.g. 0.5s) that trying to compute billions of possible passwords becomes unfeasibly slow even with very fast computers.


- Case 1: To verify a hashed password without salt, you compute ```HS256(password)```, and compare
it with the data stored on the database.

If you have access to a hash table, it is easy to decode the passwords.

if 3 of your users have ```123456``` as its password, and you use ```HS256``` algorithm without a salt to save the password, you database would look like this:

|username    | password                         |
| ---------- |:--------------------------------:|
|user1       | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |
|user7       | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |
|user13      | 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92 |

As soon as a hacker finds one password in a hash table, he knows all the other.

- Case 2: all three users have the same password, but you compute ```HS256(password+salt)``` to save the data
into your database.

|username    | salt | password                         |
| ---------- |:----:|: -------------------------------:|
|user1       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |  !!!!
|user7       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |  compute it
|user13      | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |

>Using this scheme, the hacker will have to bruteforce the hashes to get the passwords. It will take some time, but as soon as one password is cracked, all the others will be revealed too.

- Case 3: all the users have the same password, but we compute ```HS256(password+random salt)``
|username    | salt | password                         |
| ---------- |:----:|: -------------------------------:| !!compute it
|user1       | SALT | a66a96b36d78e452202c12d36b6d198c |
|user7       | ASDF | 8062279f0ba04fa6ee41d0a9e04f4c93 |
|user13      | ABCD | 5743092bfb79214247c50c4102af0b99 |

>In this case, even if all your users have the same password, the hacker cannot know without bruteforce every password. In this example the salt is very short, just 4 bytes, but you can use larger salts (128 bytes or more) and increase the difficulty to bruteforce the passwords

## 5. Bcrypt



```
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10; // <-- minimum is 1, higher means slower

/* To prepare a clear text password to be stored in a database */
const encrypt = (password, callback) => {
    bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR, (err, salt) => {
        if(err) {
          return callback(err);
        }
        bcrypt.hash(password, salt, (err, hash) => {
            if(err) {
              return callback(err);
            }
            callback(null, hash); // <-- contains the hash of the password + salt. Can be inserted into DB now.
        });
    });
};

/* 'candidatePassword' is the clear text password submitted by the user when logging in.
 * 'storedPassword' is the salted and hashed value stored in the database.
 * bcrypt will make sure the candidatePassword is correctly hashed (and salted if need be) before
 * making the comparison */
const comparePassword = (candidatePassword, storedPassword, callback) => {
    bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, storedPassword, (err, isMatch) => {
        if(err) {
          return callback(err);
        }
        callback(null, isMatch);
    });
};
```

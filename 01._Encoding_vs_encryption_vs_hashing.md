# Big world alert: encoding vs encryption vs hashing

## 1. Encoding
- **Encoding**: is **data transformation** and the goal is not to keep the data secret but to **ensure the data has the right format** for proper consumption.

  ```
  querystring.stringify({"url": "http://domain.com"});
// outputs 'url=http%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com'
  ```
## 2. Encryption
- **Encryption**:  is **data transformation** where the goal is to **ensure that data cannot be consumed by any other user except for the intended recipients**.

Example:
A hashing algorithm or in practice, the bcrypt Node module to encrypt user passwords.

## 3. Hashing

## 4. Salt factors

## 5. Bcrypt
